# community-detection
I created several useful scripts for community detection in graphs

nodal_assoc_matrix:
Calculates the nodal association matrix of multiple partitions which shows how many times nodes i & j have been assigned to the same community 


rand_coeff_zcore: 
Calculates the zscore Rand coefficient to compare community structure of graphs
